# ðŸŽµ Music Interval Trainer

A command-line ear training tool for practicing musical intervals.
It plays ascending, descending, or harmonic intervals and quizzes you based on lesson presets.

For listening only â€” no looking required. Interval names are spoken aloud after each playback.
---

## ðŸŽ¹ Features

- Supports different interval types (consonance, dissonance, etc.)
- Customizable playback formats: harmonic, melodic ascending/descending, mixed
- Spoken interval names using `espeak`
- Lesson selection via command-line
- Runs offline using a virtual environment

---

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `espeak` (for speech output, automatically installed in setup.sh script)
- `fluidsynth` (for audio output, may not be necessary, automatically installed in setup.sh script)
- Linux (Debian-based recommended) or WSL on Windows

Install `espeak` on Debian/Ubuntu (or let the setup.sh script install it for you):

```bash
sudo apt install espeak
```

---

## ðŸš€ Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Allow execution permission for setup.sh and run.sh (`sudo chmod +x setup.sh run.sh`).

3. Run the setup script (installs dependencies):

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   > This will create a virtual environment and install required Python packages.

4. Start a lesson. For example, run:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh 1
   ```

---

## ðŸ§  Usage

To show all available lessons, run:
```bash
./run.sh -l
```
To start lesson x (replace x with a number), run:
```bash
./run.sh x
```
To change the instrument to e.g. violin, run :
```bash
./run.sh 1 -i violin
```
To show all available options, run:
```
./run.sh --help
```

If you want to use the raw python script instead of running run.sh, do the same with main.py:
```bash
python3 main.py <lesson_number> [-i INSTRUMENT]
```

### Arguments:

- `<lesson_number>`: Choose a lesson (1â€“4)
- `-i, --instrument`: SCAMP instrument to use (default: `piano`)
- `-l, --list`: List available lessons
- `-p, --loop`: Loop the lesson to infinity, gotta practice more
